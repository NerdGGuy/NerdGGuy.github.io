Blogging about a Blog
---------------------

Hello Nerds,

My name is Matthew Green and in my spare time I write Haskell code.

My blog post will be written in literate Haskell.

My blog server will be written in Haskell.

My blog post will follow my adventures into writting a blog about a blog.

The end.
